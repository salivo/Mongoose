createPoint((1,3.5,None), "A")
createPoint((0,None,3.5), "B")

createPlane((7,4.5,7), "rho")

# The most common operation with planes is find second projection of a point which is in the plane
# To do that just simply do:
findPointWithPlane("A1", "rho")
# also for point in another quadrant
findPointWithPlane("B2", "rho")
